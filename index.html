        <h2>The King of Forest</h2>
        <p>Lions are one of the most powerful animals on the African savannah. Adult male lions, often referred to as the "king of the jungle," can weigh up to 550 pounds and stand up to 4 feet tall at the shoulder. They are social animals and live in groups called prides, typically consisting of related females, their cubs, and one or more adult males. Lions are carnivorous and hunt in packs, preying on large animals such as antelopes, buffalo, and zebras. They are also known for their distinctive manes and powerful roars.</p>

        <h2>The Ruler of Forest</h2>
        <p>Tigers are large, predatory felines found mainly in Asia. They are known for their distinctive orange fur with black vertical stripes, and can weigh anywhere between 220-660 pounds depending on their subspecies and age. Tigers are carnivorous and primarily hunt deer, but will also eat other animals like buffalo, wild pigs, and birds. There are seven recognized subspecies of tigers, and due to habitat loss and poaching, their populations have been declining. However, conservation efforts are being made to protect these magnificent animals.</p>
